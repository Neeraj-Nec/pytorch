# PyTorch: An Open-Source Machine Learning Framework

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Meta (Facebook). It provides a flexible and dynamic way to build and train deep learning models, particularly for computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning.

# What is PyTorch?

Think of PyTorch like a magic toolbox that helps computers learn from data, just like humans learn from experience. It’s mainly used for AI and deep learning—helping computers recognize images, understand language, and even play games.

If you’ve ever seen a self-driving car, facial recognition, or AI chatbots, there’s a good chance PyTorch was used to train them.

Why is PyTorch Popular?

✅ Easy to use and debug
✅ Runs super fast on GPUs (graphics cards)
✅ Big companies like Meta (Facebook), Tesla, and OpenAI use it
