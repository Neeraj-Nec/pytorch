# What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data (which is often represented numerically) and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario.

## Breaking Down the Definition:

1. ✅ **"Convert anything into numbers"** – Yes! ML models work with numerical data. Even images, text, and sounds are converted into numerical representations (like pixel values, word embeddings, or frequency spectrums).  
2. ✅ **"Find some pattern"** – Exactly! ML algorithms look for relationships, trends, and structures in data.  
3. ✅ **"Define some rule"** – Sort of. Instead of explicitly defining rules, ML learns rules from the data. Traditional programming uses hand-coded rules, but ML generalizes from examples.
